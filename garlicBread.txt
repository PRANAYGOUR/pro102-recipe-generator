Ingredients 

½ cup Softened butter
4 cloves garlic
2 tbsp Chopped coriander
½ tsp Black pepper
2 Mini baguettes

Using a ricer mince the garlic cloves into the softened butter.
Finely chop 2 tbsp of coriander and add it into the butter as well.

Add black pepper to the mix and using a rubber spatula incorporate all these ingredients into the butter and make sure to mix them well.
Your garlic butter is now ready.
Slice the bread diagonally so you get bigger slices.
Using a butter knife, generously apply the garlic butter on one side of each slice.

Place them in a baking tray and bake the bread at 200ºC/ 400ºF for 8-10 minutes in a pre-heated oven.
Alternatively, you can toast the bread in a frying pan as toast. For this, you have to apply the butter on both sides of the bread.
Heat the pan on medium-low and toast the bread on each side for 1-2 minutes.
Your crunchy and flavourful garlic bread is ready with or without an oven.
